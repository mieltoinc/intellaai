## What is Intella?

Intella is a platform and SDK for running AI agents inside isolated sandboxes. You use it to build and delegate tasks to durable agents that can run commands, edit files, and use tools in a controlled environment—local, E2B, Daytona, Modal, or Vercel.

## Get started

<Card title="QuickStart with SandboxAgent" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart" horizontal>
  Install the SDK, create a sandbox with SandboxAgent, run a command, and close—in a few minutes.
</Card>

If you only need to call an AI model without a sandbox (like using OpenAI or the AI SDK directly), you can use agents in the vanilla way—see [Supported agents](/agents/supported-agents).
